		<h2>Prepare your talk</h2>
		<p>Take the time to practice your talk. Improvising live on stage is nice, but have a well prepared backup.</p>
		<h3>Here's what you need to know:</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>You can select one of the three talk length options. Make sure not to exceed this limit</li>
			<li>Your talk must be in English</li>
			<li>Your slides should be in the format 16:9</li>
			<li>Your screen will be recorded so your screen will be mirrored</li>
			<li>We have a good internet connection for demos, but make sure you have a backup</li>
			<li>(Ideally) your talk will be recorded and uploaded to the internet</li>
			<li>After every talk there's a Q &amp; A session. If you don't want one, please let us know</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>Important</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>You can mention your company, products or events, but your talk should not be advertisement</li>
			<li>We want to learn something interesting and new. Be original!</li>
			<li>We like to see live demos, but keep the code short and readable</li>
			<li>Your talk must must not be discriminate, shame or in any other way make people of different races, nationalities or sexual orientation feel unpleasant.</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>Preparing for screen recording</h3>
		<p>To be able to record your talk, we'll be using StreamYard.</p>
		<p>It should be as simple as joining the video call in your browser and sharing your screen. <br><a href="https://support.streamyard.com/hc/en-us/articles/360043291612-Guest-instructions" target="_blank">Read about StreamYard</a></p>
